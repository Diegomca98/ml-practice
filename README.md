# Multiple Linear Regression

## Overview

Multiple linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between two or more independent variables (predictors) and a dependent variable (response). It extends the concept of simple linear regression by considering multiple predictors simultaneously.

In multiple linear regression, the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is modeled as a linear equation:

```
y = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ... + βᵣxᵣ + ε
```

where:
- `y` is the dependent variable
- `x₁, x₂, ..., xᵣ` are the independent variables
- `β₀, β₁, β₂, ..., βᵣ` are the coefficients
- `ε` is the error term

The goal of multiple linear regression is to estimate the coefficients (`β₀, β₁, β₂, ..., βᵣ`) that minimize the sum of squared differences between the observed and predicted values of the dependent variable.

## Warning

### 1. Linearity
> **Explanation:** Linearity in multiple linear regression means that the relationship between the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (target) is linear. It implies that the change in the dependent variable is proportional to the change in the independent variables.
>
> **Real-life Analogy:** Think of linearity like baking a cake recipe. If you double the amount of flour and sugar, you expect the size of the cake to double as well. The relationship between the ingredients and the size of the cake is linear.
>
> **If Present:** If the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable appears linear, it suggests that the linear regression model is appropriate for the data.
>
> **If Lacking:** If the relationship appears non-linear, it could indicate that a linear regression model may not be the best choice. It might be necessary to explore other regression techniques or transform the variables to better capture the underlying relationship.

### 2. Homoscedasticity
> **Explanation:** Homoskedasticity refers to the assumption that the variance of the errors (the differences between the observed and predicted values) is constant across all levels of the independent variables.
>
> **Real-life Analogy:** Imagine you're driving a car on a smooth highway. If the road surface is consistent and there are no bumps, the variability in your driving speed remains constant. This is similar to homoskedasticity, where the variability in prediction errors remains the same across different values of the independent variables.
> 
> **If Present:** If the variance of the errors (residuals) is constant across all levels of the independent variables, it suggests that the assumptions of linear regression are met, leading to more reliable estimates of the coefficients.
>
> **If Lacking:** If the variance of the errors varies across different levels of the independent variables (heteroskedasticity), it could lead to inefficient estimates of the coefficients and biased standard errors. This violates the assumption of homoskedasticity and may require corrective measures, such as transforming the variables or using robust standard errors.

### 3. Multivariate Normality
> **Explanation:** Multivariate normality means that the residuals (the differences between the observed and predicted values) are normally distributed for each combination of the independent variables.
>
> **Real-life Analogy:** Suppose you're measuring the heights of students in a classroom. If you plot a histogram of the differences between their actual heights and the heights predicted by a model, you'd expect the distribution of these differences to resemble a bell curve, indicating normality.
>
> **If Present:** If the residuals of the model are normally distributed, it indicates that the model's predictions are unbiased and reliable, allowing for valid hypothesis testing and confidence interval estimation.
>
> **If Lacking:** If the residuals are not normally distributed, it may indicate a violation of the assumption of multivariate normality. This could affect the validity of statistical inference and may require addressing through data transformation or robust methods.

### 4. Error Independency
> **Explanation:** Error independence means that the errors (residuals) in the regression model are not correlated with each other. In other words, knowing the value of one error does not provide any information about the value of another error.
> 
> **Real-life Analogy:** Suppose you're flipping a fair coin multiple times. The outcome of one coin flip (heads or tails) does not influence the outcome of subsequent flips. Similarly, in regression, the residuals from one observation should not influence the residuals of another observation.
> 
> **If Present:** If the errors (residuals) are independent of each other, it suggests that each observation provides unique information and that the model captures the underlying relationship without bias.
>
> **If Lacking:** If there is autocorrelation or serial correlation among the errors, it indicates that the observations are not independent, which violates the assumption of error independence. This could lead to biased coefficient estimates and unreliable inference, requiring techniques such as time series analysis or panel data models.

### 5. Absence of multicollinearity
> **Explanation:** Multicollinearity occurs when two or more independent variables in a regression model are highly correlated with each other. It makes it difficult to determine the individual effect of each independent variable on the dependent variable.
>
> **Real-life Analogy:** Imagine you're trying to assess the impact of both studying hours and natural intelligence on exam scores. If studying hours and natural intelligence are strongly correlated (e.g., smart students tend to study more), it becomes challenging to distinguish the unique contribution of each factor to exam performance.
>
> **If Present:** If the independent variables are not highly correlated with each other, it suggests that each predictor contributes unique information to the model, leading to stable and interpretable coefficient estimates.
> 
> **If Lacking:** If there is multicollinearity, where independent variables are highly correlated, it can lead to inflated standard errors, unstable coefficient estimates, and difficulty in interpreting the individual effects of predictors. Addressing multicollinearity may involve removing redundant variables or using regularization techniques like ridge regression.

## Usage

### Installation

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

### Example

Here's a simple example of how to perform multiple linear regression in Python using scikit-learn:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Split the data into features (X) and target variable (y)
X = data[['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3']]
y = data['target']

# Split the data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Fit the linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print("Mean Squared Error:", mse)
```
